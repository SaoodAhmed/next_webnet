                            For SEO, content duplication is one of the major problems many
                            websites come across, and still, there is no indication of why this is
                            happening even though everything seems okay.

                            If you search Google accordingly, it will say that somehow and
                            somewhere, there is some duplication of URLs.

                            years of experience, they also couldn't have figured out what had been

                            Try keeping it clean One of the reasons for keeping it clean is that
                            it states a mark on your search console, which annoys me. This is our
                            opinion to keep it clean; otherwise, anything that is blocked by
                            robots.txt will show something like this.

                            However, Google says this will not affect your SEO ranking or
                            anything, But we saw that if we manage to fix this, your ranking does
                            improve vastly, So this article will help you resolve this issue.

                        <p>
                            Duplicate content is content that has the same content on other pages.
                            Duplicate content is tricky, but when search engines recently crawled
                            many URLs with similar content, Google said it does not matter.
                            Mueller of Google said{" "}
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                if you had the same content in textual form on your website where
                                it’s clearly duplicate content then what would happen there is we
                                would pick one of those versions to show in Google Search.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s not the case that we would say: “oh this website has some
                                duplicate content, we will not show it at all in Google.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rather we will say: “There are two versions here. We will pick one
                                of these to show and we will just not show the other one.”
                            </p>

                            Why is this, so that duplicate content isn't affecting your ranking?
                            Because many retailers use the same content, images, and description
                            on their websites. Secondly, if you have duplicate content, this means
                            that Google will ignore that page from crawling resulting in a waste
                            of content that is unique on that page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, even if your content is going on a good ranking, search
                            engines may pick the wrong URL as the "original" using
                            canonicalisation that helps you control your duplicate content.
